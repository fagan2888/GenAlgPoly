Summary results for different regression methods on the Housing, Abalone, Auto MPG and Kinematics datasets. Random Forests, an ensemble method (``2'' in the plots), has the better results. However \ac{GAPoly} achieves similar errors in two of the datasets. For the remaining two \ac{GAPoly} produces similar errors to the other classic regression methods.  The regression methods depicted in these figures are: 1. \ac{GAPoly}, 2. Random Forests, 3. Linear Regression, 4. SVM, 5. Regression Trees and 6. Conditional Inference Trees
