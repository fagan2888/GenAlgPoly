While many applications require models that have no acceptable linear approximation, the simpler nonlinear models are defined by polynomials. The use of genetic algorithms to find polynomial models from data is known as Evolutionary Polynomial Regression. This paper introduces Evolutionary Polynomial Regression with Regularization, an algorithm that extends the EPR method and describes a set of experiences on common datasets that compare both flavors of EPR and other methods including Linear Regression, Regression Trees and Support Vector Regression.

The empiric conclusion of those experiments is that EPR with regularization is able to achieve better fitting than other non-ensemble methods and it has shorter computation time than plain EPR.
