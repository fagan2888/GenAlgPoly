#EPRR Conclusions

* The eprr is better at finding exact regression if the dataset is polynomial;
* But the computation time is always worst when compared with SVMs;
* For "other" datasets it seems worst... what somehow contradicts JPN results;
* A **better strategy** would be to focus on polynomial datasets and further develop the method there;
