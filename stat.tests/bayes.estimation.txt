A Bayesian Estimation was computed, which estimates the difference in means between two groups and yields a probability distribution over the difference. On the Abalone dataset errors are improved wrt EPR in a difference in means, for all tested $\lambda$ values less than $1$, resulted in a 95% HDI (Highest Density Interval) equal to [0.01, 0.02] which achieves statistical significance. On the Auto-MPG dataset the 95% HDI is [-0.01, 0.008] which includes zero. On the Housing dataset the 95% HDI is [-0.02, 0.05], for $\lambda = 0.7$, which includes zero. On the Kinematics dataset the results were cleary better for all $\lambda$ values less than $1$.
