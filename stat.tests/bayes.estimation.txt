A Bayesian Estimation was computed, which estimates the difference in means between two groups and yields a probability distribution over the difference. On the Abalone dataset errors are improved wrt EPR in a difference in means, resulted in a 95% HDI (Highest Density Interval) equal to [0.01, 0.021] which achieves statistical significance. On the Auto-MPG dataset the 95% HDI is [-0.007, 0.022] which barely includes zero. On the Housing dataset the 95% HDI is [-0.03, 0.053] which includes zero. On the Kinematics dataset the 95% HDI is [0.02, 0.08] which achieves statistical significance. Even if some results are not statistically significant, all mean differences favor the regularization variant.
